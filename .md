## 🔹 Slide 21 – Testing: Goals
> “In this slide, we tested the *Goals module* of the FinGo application.
> We verified whether users can successfully create financial goals, add savings to those goals, and whether the system automatically marks a goal as completed when the target amount is reached.
> We also tested *edge cases* such as adding zero savings and adding savings beyond the target amount.
> These tests ensured that goal progress calculations are accurate and that the system behaves correctly in all situations.
> As shown in the screenshots, the module worked as expected, so the test status is *Pass*.”
## 🔹 Slide 22 – Testing: Pie Charts
> “This slide represents the testing of the *Pie Charts module*.
> We performed *GUI testing* to ensure that the charts are displayed clearly and correctly.
> The charts visually represent income versus expenses and goal progress.
> We verified that whenever a new transaction is added, the pie charts update *in real time* without restarting the application.
> This confirms that the visual analytics feature of FinGo is accurate, interactive, and user-friendly.
> Therefore, the test result for this module is *Pass*.”

## 🔹 Slide 23 – Testing: Monthly Report
> “In this slide, we tested the *Monthly Report* feature.
> The application generates popup reports showing expenses for the last *30, 60, and 90 days*.
> We verified data accuracy, sorting order, readability, and loading performance.
> This feature helps users analyze recent spending patterns and control unnecessary expenses.
> Testing confirmed that the reports are accurate and easy to understand, so the module successfully *passed testing*.”

## 🔹 Slide 24 – Phase 6: Deployment & Maintenance
> “This slide explains the *Deployment and Maintenance* phase.
> The FinGo application can be deployed on any system with Python 3.x, required libraries, and MySQL installed.
> Users can run the application by executing the *main.py* file.
> For maintenance, we plan to fix bugs, improve the user interface, optimize database queries, and add new features such as editing transactions, advanced charts, and predictive budgeting.
> This phase ensures that the application remains efficient, reliable, and ready for future enhancements.”

## 🔹 Slide 25 – Conclusion
> “To conclude, FinGo is a simple and user-friendly personal finance application that makes money management easier.
> It allows users to track income, expenses, savings, and financial goals in one place.
> Features like pie charts and monthly reminders help users clearly understand their spending habits.
> By following the *Waterfall Model* and performing thorough testing, we ensured that the application is stable, accurate, and reliable.
> Overall, FinGo helps users plan their finances better and make smarter financial decisions.”

## 🔹 If Asked: *“What was your role in this project?”*
**Perfect Answer**
> “We first finalized the project idea as a team of five members.
> The *planning phase* was handled by **D. Ashok** and **K. Pardha Saradhi**, and it was reviewed by all team members.
> I, along with **K. Pavan Sai** and **K. Yamini**, worked on the *analysis and requirements phase*, which was verified by the entire team.
> For *system design and ER diagram*, **K. Yamini**, **K. Pardha Saradhi**, and I prepared the design, again reviewed by all five members.
> During *implementation and coding*, all team members collaborated to develop and integrate different modules.
> *Testing and verification* were performed together by all five of us.
> Finally, we collectively worked on *deployment and maintenance* to ensure the system is efficient and future-ready.”

## 🔹 If Asked: *“How will you extend this project?”*

**Director-Level Answer**
> “We plan to extend this project by converting it into a *web-based application*.
> The frontend will be developed as an *open-source website UI* using *HTML and CSS* for structure and styling, and *JavaScript* for interactivity and client-side validation.
> The application will be accessible to all users directly through a *web browser*, without requiring any special software or permissions.
> For the backend, we plan to use *PHP with the Laravel framework* to handle server-side logic, authentication, and API development.
> The existing *MySQL database* will be reused and expanded with additional tables and relationships to support multiple users, detailed reports, and secure data storage.
> Future features include user profiles, budget planning tools, expense alerts, advanced analytics dashboards, and *role-based access control*.
> Since the UI will be *open-source*, it can be easily improved and reused by other developers.”

**Technology Stack**
> Our FinGo application code is structured using Python, Tkinter for GUI, MySQL for database handling, and Matplotlib for charts.
We have created **14 user-defined functions** to handle different parts of the program.
